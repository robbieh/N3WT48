======

Just a "new tab page" / startpage in a cyberpunk style.

Configuration
=============

Both the color and set of links are configurable.

Links
-----

Edit `pages.js` and add in your links. You can have different sets of links as
shown in the default file included with N3WT48. Just pass the set you want to
use on the URL, for example `?pages=work`

Be sure to follow JavaScript conventions (don't forget the commas).

Colors
------
Pass `color=XXX` on the URL. Green is the default, but N3WT48 currently
handles `red` and `yellow` by this parameter.


Setup
=====

N3WT48 has been tested with Firefox and Chrome.

Firefox Setup
-------------

If you only want a startpage, just uncompress the release to your local
filesystem and open it in Firefox. Then set that URL as your homepage.

For a new tab page, you'll have to host the files on your own webserver and use
the https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-tab-override/[New Tab
Override] extension.
